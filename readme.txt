Allows you to setup single sign on capabilities between your site and Freshdesk. Create's user accounts on the fly, automatically logs in users.

== Description ==

If you've used Freshdesk before then you know how awesome it is as both a support ticket system and a community forum. The only problem is that now your users have to remember one more username and password just to access those new features. What's the solution? Freshdesk Remote Authentication!

You can configure your Wordpress based website and Freshdesk to work together in perfect harmony to give your users the gift of one less username/password combination to remember.
